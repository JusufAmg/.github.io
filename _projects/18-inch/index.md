I defined performance requirements and selected all major propulsion and power components, including motors, ESCs, and propeller sizing, to meet the target specifications.

I guided the mechanical design with electrical routing and cable management as a primary constraint, ensuring serviceability, EMI control, and reliable integration. I handled flight controller configuration, tuning, and iterative test flights, validating stability and performance through real-world operation.
